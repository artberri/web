I am a 33 years old Full Stack Developer based in <a data-toggle="bilbaoModal" href="#bilbaoModal">Bilbao</a>. I am passionate about everything
related to web development and I'm currently working as Development Manager at <a href="http://www.travioor.com">Travioor</a>. The easiest way
to get in touch is via email: [alberto@berriart.com](mailto:alberto@berriart.com).

## <i class="fi-monitor"></i> Web development

My preferred back-end languages are PHP and Javascript (Node.js). I'm also front-end developer, I've worked with AngularJS, jQuery and
a lot of Vanilla JS. I have used MySQL and MongoDB as data storage. I'm open for alternatives when is necessary.

## <i class="fi-widget"></i> Continous Integration

I have implemented continous integration and continous deployment pipelines in multiple projects, including source control, software and
infrastructure automatic provisioning, unit testing, deployment, functional testing, monitoring and notifications.

## <i class="fi-clipboard-pencil"></i> Analysis &amp; Planning

I have experience heading medium and small projects: choosing technology, planning, estimating duration, spreading the workload between
coworkers... and using Agile methodologies.

## <i class="fi-lock"></i> DevOps

I believe that collaboration between development and operations is possible and I like contributing making it real. I have experience managing classic Linux
server and the new cloud technologies.

## <i class="fi-target-two"></i> SEO and Web Analytics

I like SEO, not all kinds, but the in-page SEO. I allways try to optimize the sites for search engines when coding: web performance,
the HTML structure, semantics, microdata, linkbuilding... I've also configured analytics in sites to measure ROI.

## <i class="fi-lightbulb"></i> Others

I am a self-taught, but I love working with people who know and can teach me. I think my two best qualities are that I like to teach what I know and
that I know I have still a lot to learn.
